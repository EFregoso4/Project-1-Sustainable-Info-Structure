        <h3>Accessing Library Services</h3>
        <p>If you are a newly admitted student and have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, you can find details on the <a href="#">Hawk Card Homepage</a>. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services.</p>
        <p>Even without a Hawk Card, you can access online journals and perform all search functions through the library website. You only need the card to check out materials in person at Galvin Library or request materials via interlibrary loan.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="myIIT-access">
        <h3>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h3>
        <p>Although you can search directly through the library website, the best method is to first log in to myIIT and click on the "Library Resources" link. Access through myIIT uses a proxy server, letting you access most resources without reentering your login information.</p>

          <figcaption>The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The library website offers multiple search options. Begin with scholarly databases like Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO) to search multiple journals at once.</p>

      <h2>Research Timelines</h2>

      <article id="formulating-timeline">
        <h3>Formulating a Timeline</h3>
        <p>Consider your assignment's due date when requesting resources. Use this formula:</p>
        <p><strong>Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your project &lt; Remaining time before deadline</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Time to obtain resource:</strong> How long will it take to receive or get the resource?</li>
          <li><strong>Time to read resource:</strong> How long will it take to read and understand the material?</li>
          <li><strong>Time to integrate resource:</strong> Do you have enough time to incorporate the material into your work?</li>
          <li><strong>Remaining time:</strong> How much time remains before the deadline?</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="sidebar">
          <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
          <p>Don't assume you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. Only request resources you can realistically read and use within your timeline.</p>

        <h3>Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</h3>
        <p>Bridgette, a Tech Comm graduate student, is researching the development of technical communication before WWII. She logs into myIIT, searches databases, and finds several relevant articles. To manage her time, she creates a research timeline in Google Calendar, ensuring she has enough time to obtain, read, and incorporate resources into her project.</p>
