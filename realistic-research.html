    <section id="getting-started">
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
	  
	       <article id="library-access">
        <h3>Accessing Library Services</h3>
        <p>If you are a newly admitted student and have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, you can find details on the <a href="#">Hawk Card Homepage</a>. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services.</p>
        <p>Even without a Hawk Card, you can access online journals and perform all search functions through the library website. You only need the card to check out materials in person at Galvin Library or request materials via interlibrary loan.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="myIIT-access">
        <h3>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h3>
        <p>Although you can search directly through the library website, the best method is to first log in to myIIT and click on the "Library Resources" link. Access through myIIT uses a proxy server, letting you access most resources without reentering your login information.</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/research2.jpg" alt="Library Services icon leading to library search website">
          <figcaption>The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The library website offers multiple search options. Begin with scholarly databases like Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO) to search multiple journals at once.</p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section id="research-timelines">
      <h2>Research Timelines</h2>

      <article id="formulating-timeline">
        <h3>Formulating a Timeline</h3>
        <p>Consider your assignment's due date when requesting resources. Use this formula:</p>
        <p><strong>Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your project &lt; Remaining time before deadline</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Time to obtain resource:</strong> How long will it take to receive or get the resource?</li>
          <li><strong>Time to read resource:</strong> How long will it take to read and understand the material?</li>
          <li><strong>Time to integrate resource:</strong> Do you have enough time to incorporate the material into your work?</li>
          <li><strong>Remaining time:</strong> How much time remains before the deadline?</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="sidebar">
          <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
          <p>Don't assume you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. Only request resources you can realistically read and use within your timeline.</p>
        </aside>
      </article>

      <article id="timeline-case-study">
        <h3>Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</h3>
        <p>Bridgette, a Tech Comm graduate student, is researching the development of technical communication before WWII. She logs into myIIT, searches databases, and finds several relevant articles. To manage her time, she creates a research timeline in Google Calendar, ensuring she has enough time to obtain, read, and incorporate resources into her project.</p>
      </article>
	  
	  <article id="obtaining-resources">
        <h3>Determining the Best Way to Obtain Resources</h3>
        <p>Preview a resource before requesting it to ensure its value. Options include physically obtaining the book or using interlibrary loan services like MyILL. Consider the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Stated turnaround time (allow extra buffer time)</li>
          <li>Proximity of the lending library</li>
          <li>Possibility that materials may not arrive before your deadline</li>
        </ul>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section id="requesting-resources">
      <h2>Requesting Resources</h2>

      <article id="request-articles">
        <h3>Requesting Articles</h3>
        <p>If articles are not downloadable as PDFs, you can request them through MyILL:</p>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/research4_image1.jpg" alt="Example of an article not available for PDF download">
          <figcaption>Clicking "Get Article" may require a MyILL request.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img src="images/research4_image2.jpg" alt="MyILL request page for an article">
          <figcaption>For this resource, the only option is to request the article through MyILL.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>You must register a MyILL account separately from myIIT. You'll receive an email when the article is ready to download.</p>
      </article>

      <article id="request-books">
        <h3>Requesting a Book from Another Library</h3>
        <p>Begin by searching the IIT library system, then I-Share, and finally WorldCat if necessary.</p>

        <aside class="sidebar">
          <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
          <p>Keep a list of all resources you find on Google Docs or a flash drive—you may not remember them later.</p>
        </aside>

        <p>Refer to the Library FAQ and How-to Pages for detailed instructions.</p>

        <article class="case-study">
          <h4>Case Study: Searching and Requesting Resources</h4>
          <p>Bridgette requests articles, finds "English for Engineers" by S.A. Harbarger, notes it in Google Docs, and checks its availability through I-Share.</p>
        </article>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section id="local-libraries">
      <h2>Local Libraries</h2>

      <article id="ishare-libraries">
        <h3>I-Share Libraries</h3>
        <p>I-Share libraries often allow direct book checkout with an IIT ID. Example: Daley Library at UIC. Other universities like Loyola and University of Chicago have restrictions.</p>

        <aside class="sidebar">
          <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
          <p>Call ahead to confirm library hours and access to stacks before making a trip.</p>
        </aside>

        <ul>
          <li>Library location</li>
          <li>Ability to enter the library</li>
          <li>Library hours</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article id="public-libraries">
        <h3>Public Libraries</h3>
        <p>Chicago Public Library (CPL) offers many books not found in I-Share. Visitors can read or copy books even if they cannot check them out. Proof of residency is needed for a library card.</p>
      </article>

      <article class="case-study">
        <h4>Case Study: Obtaining a Resource from an I-Share Library</h4>
        <p>Bridgette has 10 days left for her paper and decides to pick up "English for Engineers" from UIC. She checks library hours and policies to avoid wasting time.</p>
      </article>
    </section>

    <section id="web-resources">
      <h2>Internet Resources</h2>

      <article id="online-resources">
        <h3>Some Resources to Consider</h3>
        <p>Online resources can save you trips to the library. Examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Public domain writings</li>
          <li>Creative Commons licensed resources</li>
          <li>Media files (video, audio, images)</li>
        </ul>
      </article>

      <article id="web-research">
        <h3>Using Web Resources for Research</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Google Scholar:</strong> Search scholarly articles and see citations</li>
          <li><strong>Google Books:</strong> Preview or read full books</li>
          <li><strong>Web of Science:</strong> Search scientific papers and citations</li>
        </ul>

        <aside class="sidebar">
          <h4>Being Realistic</h4>
          <p>If stuck, search special issues, yearbooks, or edited volumes. These provide snapshots of research and useful context.</p>
        </aside>

        <article class="case-study">
          <h4>Case Study: Using Web Resources</h4>
          <p>Bridgette investigates citations of Connors' 1982 article to find atypical examples of technical writing instruction before WWII using Google Scholar.</p>
